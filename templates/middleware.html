            <p>Middleware is software which lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications. It is sometimes called plumbing, as it connects two applications together so data and databases can be easily passed between the “pipe.” Using middleware allows users to perform such requests as submitting forms on a web browser or allowing the web server to return dynamic web pages based on a user’s profile.</p>
            <p>Common middleware examples include database middleware, application server middleware, message-oriented middleware, web middleware and transaction-processing monitors. Each programme typically provides messaging services so that different applications can communicate using messaging frameworks like simple object access protocol (SOAP), web services, representational state transfer (REST) and JavaScript object notation (JSON). While all middleware performs communication functions, the type a company chooses to use will depend on what service is being used and what type of information needs to be communicated. This can include security authentication, transaction management, message queues, applications servers, web servers and directories. Middleware can also be used for distributed processing with actions occurring in real time rather than sending data back and forth.</p>
            <h3><center>Types of Middleware</center></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><h5>Message Oriented Middleware (MOM)</h5>
                    Message oriented middleware is one of the most widely used types of middleware. With message oriented middleware, it becomes less complicated to use applications spread over various platforms and working across various operating systems and network protocols.</li>
                 <li><h5>Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Middleware</h5>This is a client-server interaction that makes it possible for the functionality of an application to be distributed across multiple platforms.

                    This type of middleware is a protocol that is used by a local program to request a service from a program located on a remote computer without having particulars of network details.</li>   
                <li><h5>Database Middleware</h5>This type of middleware allows direct access and interaction with a database. Database middleware is the most common and most widely used type of middleware.

                    It is mostly used by developers as a mechanism to request information from a database hosted either locally or remotely.
                    
                    A good example of database middleware is the SQL database software.</li>
                <li><h5>Object Middleware</h5>Also known as an object request broker, the role of object middleware is to control the communication between objects in distributed computing.

                    Object middleware allows one computer to make program calls to another through a computer network.
                    
                    It also allows requests and objects to be sent through an object-oriented system.</li>
                <li><h5>Transaction Processing (TP) Middleware</h5>This is a type of middleware whose role is to reinforce the function of electronic transactions.

                    Transactional middleware does this by controlling transaction apps, pushing database updates related to the transaction and enforcing the business rules and logic of the transaction.
                    
                    </li>
                <li><h5>Robotic Middleware</h5>This type of middleware is very handy when it comes building extensive software systems for controlling robot systems.

                    Robotic middleware helps to manage and control the heterogeneity and complexity of the hardware and software systems that form part of a robot.
                    </li>
                <li><h5>Integration Middleware</h5>This type of middleware provides an integration framework through which operations, executions and runtime services from several apps can be monitored and controlled.

                    Integration middleware can also be useful in combining data from several different sources into one unified platform where users can access and manipulate the data.
                    </li>
                <li><h5>Application Framework</h5>This is a framework that provides the basic structure on which applications for a particular environment can be built.
                    
                    The application framework acts as a backbone that supports the application. It also provides a server on which the application will run.
                    
                    Using an application framework makes the application development process a lot simpler.</li>   
                <li><h5>Device Middleware</h5>This is a type of middleware that provides a set of tools which are used to build applications meant to be run in a specific hardware environment.</li>  
                <li><h5>Game Engines</h5>This type of middleware provides game designers with access to tools that make the game creation process easier.

                    Game engines utilize tools such as game scripting, physics simulations, and graphics rendering.
                    </li>  
                <li><h5>Portals</h5>Though they might not actually be a type of middleware, enterprise portal servers are also sometimes referred to middleware because they enable a smooth front-end integration.

                    The main role of portals is to allow interaction between a client device and back end systems.
                    </li>  
                <li><h5>Content-Centric Middleware</h5>
                    This is a type of middleware that makes it possible for developers to extract some piece of content without having to know how the system obtains the content.
                    
                    This type of middleware is commonly used in most content-oriented web-based applications.</li>
